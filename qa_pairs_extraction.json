      "answer": "You need CGL (commercial general liability) covering both school and sports activities, professional liability/errors & omissions, and property insurance. For the TBS option, try Great American Insurance Company and ask them to: 1) List both school activities and sports activities in the insured operations on the General Liability, and 2) Add an endorsement for professional liability onto the CGL.

      "answer": "Coaches can incorporate as they like: For-Profit is easiest, Non-Profit can make real estate cheaper, 501c3 is fine too. It can be a standalone LLC (not subsidiary of TSA).

      "answer": "For morning class (from 9am - 11:30am): Assuming the microschool is 15 students, a classroom or coworking space that comfortably fits 15 students is all that's necessary. Generally 600-900 square feet is great. For afternoon sports practice (from 11:30am - 3:30pm): Space for sports training is needed.

For dyslexia, we use Lalilo (phonics & reading program) and Clear Fluency (oral reading practice). We've had learners with disabilities succeed beyond expectations with 2 Hour Learning. Behind the scenes, Timeback's dedicated curriculum team reviews student data and guide feedback to pinpoint issues. The 2 Hour Learning team will then recommend the exact lessons and learning strategies for the student based on their learning needs. Our parent platform gives parents real-time visibility into their child's progress with automatic alerts if performance dips. Students have access to: Testing apps to track mastery, 10+ different Alpha created and the very best learning apps, daily progress reports, a goal-setting platform, productivity data, Visual model AI-tutor that tracks student's screen and suggests improvements, and Zoom virtual calls with human tutor.",

That fee includes: Access to Timeback software, Marketing support from the TSA team, Cognia Accreditation, Access to School Choice Vouchers.

      "answer": "We use Stripe connect — parents pay tuition via platform (there's a fee). We pay the $10k credit via ACH transfer (stripe has an ACH fee of $0.25). Coach connects their bank account (via Stripe connect). We collect necessary info (perhaps 501c3 — if so it discounts). Parents pay fees through hosted payment page / embedded form. Funds flow into the coach's connect account. So in short, we use Stripe (2.2% + $0.30 nonprofit rates) meaning you'll get paid 2.2% less.",

      "answer": "These are paid out to coaches monthly. Our platform fee will be withheld. If you're running your school for 10 months and the tuition is $15k, that's $1500 a month. Given we charge $4k, you'd get paid $1100 a month per student. Payments are delivered immediately on student signing and the 1st of each month. Payments are sent through Stripe connect — they typically take 2-3 business days to arrive in the coaches bank account.",

      "answer": "For every student that has paid tuition, you'll receive payouts on the 1st of each Month for 10 months. We'll initiate payouts the same day tuition is paid (typically takes 2-3 days to hit your bank account). For families that pay the full tuition, the payout will be based on the tuition minus our fee, divided by 10 months. The payout amount includes the parent paid tuition, our scholarship, and then academic software fee is withheld to avoid having to invoice back and forth.",

      "question": "How do taxes work for the scholarship payments?",
      "answer": "We're doing an affiliate agreement, so this is a contractor relationship. We'll pay by bank/wire transfer — coach does their taxes (income & self-employment). Before we pay, we need each coach to fill out a W-9 (it gives us their tax ID). After the year ends, we need to file a 1099-NEC and send them a copy. We treat you as an independent contractor under our affiliate agreement. We'll pay you $10k/student by bank transfer straight, no withholding. You then handle your own taxes.",

      "answer": "In short, yes - one would be received each year. The Texas school choice vouchers are ~$10k and don't kick in until Fall 2026. For this year, Texas Sports Academy is providing scholarships that simulate these vouchers so coaches can start their schools this year. These scholarships are for this upcoming school year only. How it works is we ask our coaches to charge $15k tuition per student. When parents apply for your school, they will then be prompted to apply for a scholarship afterwards. If a parent receives a scholarship, they would only need to pay $5k instead of $10k to attend a school.",

      "answer": "There's no academic requirement to qualify for the voucher, students just need to submit a test score. The same applies for our scholarships for this upcoming school year. Tuition is $15k and the scholarship would cover $10.8k. Parents would need to pay the remaining $4.2k out of pocket. IMPORTANTLY - There's no guarantee that a family, even with disabilities or <$150k household income, will earn a voucher. So think of the voucher as a bonus.",

      "question": "For the kids that can't afford it are there any financial aid programs like in college?",
      "answer": "Given we are providing scholarships, there are no financial aid programs at the moment. Coaches can offer financial aid out of their own revenue, but that is entirely up to the coach (our TSA fee remains the same). To explain the value for parents: By attending this type of sports school, players will get to train daily from 11:30am - 3:30pm. That's four extra hours of training they get each day while their competition is still in school. This equals 20 extra hours a week and 80 extra hours of training a month.",

    {
      "question": "Can you provide some more depth on the eligibility for ESA payments through an affiliate agreement with TSA?",
      "answer": "To be a preapproved ESA provider, a school must: Hold Texas Private School Accreditation Commission-recognized accreditation (Cognia works), Administer a nationally norm-referenced test to grades 3–12 each year (like the MAP Test), Have operated a campus continuously for two school years (like Alpha/TSA). Texas Sports Academy meets all three and is therefore an 'approved provider.' Any campus that signs our affiliate agreement automatically 'rides under' TSA's approval.

      "answer": "We will put their accommodations in the system if it has to do with additional time to take a test or the like. However, we don't have what the public school districts have as far as 'case manager, director of special education, speech therapist, ARD facilitator' goes. We have guides, that is all.
